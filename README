50 Shades of Sudo Abuse Demo Material

Description:  This will create a local setup of what was used during the VetSecConJr 2020 talk "50 Shades of Sudo Abuse".  Was done live with Ubuntu 19.10.  Ideal setup is a beater/practice VM that you don't mind getting wrecked and reverting if something goes wrong.  If you do decide to put this on something more important, I tried my best to make it "overlay" as good as possible while leaving existing services and functionality.  

Requirements (install separate):
	* gcc
	* python
	* pip
	* python3
	* wget
	* base64
	* man
	* ruby
	* expect
	* sudoedit
	* visudo
	* sudo
	* systemctl or service
	* cron
	* php
	* nc, netcat, whatever


Install:  ./install.sh

* Will create backup of /etc/shadow -> /etc/shadow.bak
* Will create backup of /etc/passwd -> /etc/passwd.bak
* Will create backup of /etc/sudoers -> /etc/sudoers.bak
* Will create backup of /etc/crontab -> /etc/crontab.bak
* Will create backup of /etc/group -> /etc/group.bak
* Will create backup of /home  -> /home.bak

* Will append to /etc/shadow
* Will append to /etc/passwd
* Will append to /etc/sudoers
* Will append to /etc/crontab
* Will append to /etc/group
* Will append to /home/

* Will create /etc/sudoers_fifty/sudoers_fifty
